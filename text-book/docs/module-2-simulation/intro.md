# Introduction to Digital Twin (Gazebo & Simulation)

This module explores the world of robot simulation using Gazebo, creating digital twins of physical robotic systems. Simulation is a critical component of modern robotics development, allowing for testing, validation, and training in safe, repeatable environments before deploying to real hardware.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Set up and configure Gazebo simulation environments
- Create robot models and world descriptions
- Implement physics-based simulation with realistic sensors
- Design humanoid test scenarios and validation procedures
- Integrate simulation with real-world robot control systems

## Module Overview

This module covers the fundamentals of simulation-based robotics development, from basic world creation to complex humanoid robot testing. We'll explore how digital twins accelerate development cycles and enable safe testing of complex robotic behaviors.
