# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

<p>Welcome to the comprehensive Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This educational resource covers the modern robotics learning stack, from fundamental concepts to advanced cognitive robotics integration.</p>

## Course Overview

<p>This textbook is structured into four progressive modules:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Module 1: Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)</strong> - Learn the fundamentals of ROS 2 including nodes, topics, services, and actions</li>
<li><strong>Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Simulation)</strong> - Explore simulation environments and digital twin concepts</li>
<li><strong>Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)</strong> - Understand perception, navigation, and AI integration</li>
<li><strong>Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)</strong> - Integrate all concepts in cognitive robotics with natural language interaction</li>
</ol>

## Learning Outcomes

<p>After completing this textbook, students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design and implement ROS 2-based robotic systems</li>
<li>Create and simulate robotic environments using Gazebo</li>
<li>Implement perception and navigation systems using NVIDIA Isaac</li>
<li>Integrate voice commands with robotic actions in a complete cognitive system</li>
</ul>

## Prerequisites

<ul>
<li>Basic programming knowledge (Python preferred)</li>
<li>Understanding of linear algebra and calculus</li>
<li>Familiarity with Linux command line</li>
</ul>

## Getting Started

<p>Begin with Module 1 to establish the foundational knowledge required for the subsequent modules. Each module is designed to be completed in 2-3 weeks, with the entire course taking approximately 13 weeks.</p>
<p>The content includes hands-on examples, practical exercises, and assessments to reinforce learning. All examples are tested and reproducible in the provided development environment.</p>
