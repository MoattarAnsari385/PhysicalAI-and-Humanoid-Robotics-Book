# Introduction to The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

This module introduces the fundamental concepts of ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), which serves as the communication backbone for robotic systems. Think of ROS 2 as the "nervous system" of a robot - it enables different components to communicate, coordinate actions, and share sensory information. ROS 2 provides a flexible framework for writing robot software with features like distributed computing, real-time support, and improved security compared to its predecessor.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the architecture and concepts of ROS 2 as a robotic middleware
- Create and manage nodes, topics, services, and actions for robot communication
- Bridge Python agents to ROS controllers using rclpy client library
- Design robot models using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) for humanoid robots
- Implement distributed robot control systems with proper message passing

## Module Overview

This module covers the essential building blocks of ROS 2, from basic communication patterns to advanced humanoid robot modeling. We'll explore how ROS 2 enables complex robotic systems to communicate effectively, manage distributed computation, and maintain real-time performance requirements - all critical for humanoid robotics applications.
