# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### AI-Native Authoring
AI-native authoring using Claude Code + Spec-Kit Plus: All content creation and project management must leverage AI-assisted development tools; Content must be structured for both human authoring and AI collaboration; Clear workflow integration between human expertise and AI assistance required.

### Technical Accuracy in Robotics
Technical accuracy in robotics, ROS 2 (Humble Hawksbill), Gazebo 11, NVIDIA Isaac Sim 2025, and VLA: All technical claims must be sourced from official ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac, and VLA documentation; Code examples must be verified against current official documentation; Technical content must align with industry-standard practices and current software versions.

### Academic Excellence for Engineering Learners
Clear academic content for university-level engineering learners: Content must be structured for progressive learning from theory to practice; Learning outcomes clearly defined for each module and chapter; Material must be appropriate for university-level engineering students with Flesch-Kincaid grade 10–12 readability.

### Practical Hands-On Guidance
Practical, hands-on guidance for simulation and edge deployment: All code examples must be tested and reproducible in ROS 2 Ubuntu environment; Simulation examples must reflect accurate robotics constructs (URDF, physics, perception); Content must provide clear, actionable steps for practical implementation.

### Modular and Reusable Structure
Modular and reusable structure for learning progression: Content must be organized in a modular fashion to support different learning paths; Chapters and sections should be reusable for different course structures; Terminology and standards aligned with robotics industry practices.

### Educational Technology Integration
Docusaurus-based book framework with GitHub Pages hosting: All content must be structured in Docusaurus-compatible markdown format; Deployment workflow must support GitHub Pages hosting; Content must be fully navigable and styled for educational readability.

## Additional Constraints
Technology stack requirements: Framework: Docusaurus-based book hosted on GitHub Pages; Content automation using Spec-Kit Plus tasks (chapter planning + implementation); English primary language (Urdu translation optional in later phases); Book should be fully navigable and styled for educational readability; Code and simulation examples must run on standard ROS 2 Ubuntu setup.

## Development Workflow
Content development must follow Spec-Kit Plus methodology: Use spec-driven development for all content creation; Chapter planning and implementation using automated task workflows; Clear version control and review process for content changes; Integration with GitHub workflows for automated deployment.

## Governance
This constitution governs all aspects of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook development: All content creation and project decisions must align with these principles; Amendments require documentation and approval through established project governance; All technical content must meet the specified accuracy and readability standards; Use CLAUDE.md for runtime development guidance.
